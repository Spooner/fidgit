h1. Fidgit

Fidgit is a GUI Framework built on Gosu and Chingu.

h2. Description

The API is slightly based on FXRuby (being the GUI framework I know most intimately).
It was originally developed as a part of the Sidney game, but as it got more complex, it was
obvious it would be useful to separate.

WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY ALPHA DEVELOPMENT AND THE API IS LIABLE TO CONTINUOUS CHANGE!

h2. Requirements

* Gosu gem.
* Chingu gem.
* Ruby 1.9.2 (sorry, I'm lazy!).h2. Alternative frameworks* Rubygoo** Use this if you need compatibility with RubyGame (it works with RubyGame or Gosu).** The API is a little more cumbersome than Fidgit.* GGLib (Gosu Gui Library)**  h3. Why choose Fidgit?* Fidgit is completely compatible with the Chingu extension library (particularly since Fidgit::GuiState is a Chingu::GameState).* Fidgit contains considerably more advanced widgits than the alternatives.

h2. Alternative GUI frameworks

* RubyGoo
** Additionally supports Rubygame (as well as Gosu).
** Relatively cumbersome API.
** Only simple widgets are implemented.

* GGLib (Gosu GUI Library)
** Offers graphical theme settings.
** Only simple widgets are implemented.
