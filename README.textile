h1. Fidgit

Fidgit is a GUI framework built on Gosu and Chingu.

h2. Description

The API is slightly based on FXRuby (being the GUI framework I know most intimately).
It was originally developed as a part of the Sidney game, but as it got more complex, it was
obvious it would be useful to separate.

_WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY ALPHA DEVELOPMENT AND THE API IS LIABLE TO CONTINUOUS CHANGE!_
